"""
This example shows how to use the add_workflow_history_to_steps flag to add workflow history to the steps.
In this case we have a multi-step workflow with a single agent.

We show different scenarios of a continuous execution of the workflow.
We have 5 different demos:
- Customer Support
- Medical Consultation
- Tutoring
