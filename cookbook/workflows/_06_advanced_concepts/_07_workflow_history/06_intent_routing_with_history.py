"""
Smart Customer Service Router with Shared History

This example demonstrates:
1. A simple Router that routes to different specialist agents
2. All agents share the same conversation history for context continuity
3. The power of shared context across different agents

The router uses basic intent detection, but the real value is in the shared history.
